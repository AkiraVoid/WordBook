纯自用，发出来给朋友参考的。有 Issue 可以发，但是发出来我多半没时间改，急的可以提交 Pull Request，Review 的时间还是有的。

目前支持日语和英语，因为这是我自己要学的语言，后期有时间了可能会加多语言支持。

该源码在 [GLWT（Good Luck With That，祝你好运）公共许可证](https://github.com/me-shaon/GLWTPL/blob/master/translations/LICENSE_zh-CN)下开源，所以如果你要用请自求多福。

This is made for self-using, I published it here is mainly for sharing with friends. You can create issues but I mostly have no time to fix, create pull request instead if you are impatient.

This app now support Japanese and English, because these are languages I am currently learning. Maybe I will add multi-language support later when I have time.
